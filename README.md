# Java Learning Journey

This repository contains code and notes from my ongoing Java learning course on YouTube, from the channel **Scaler (by Scaler)**. The course covers various topics in Java, with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The videos provide in-depth explanations and code examples that are structured in this repository for easy reference and study.
